We can now create lists, add items and check items as "done".

Exercises:

  * Decode the parameters; when the query string contains %ab you should substitute with the ascii character whose hex code is "ab".  For instance: try creating a list with the name "foo!" (with the exclamation point.)
  * It's not possible to uncheck an item.  Make it possible.
