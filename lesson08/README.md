This is the first iteration of development of a clone of http://tadalist.com.  See also the description of the project in http://matteo.vaccari.name/aw/2011/lezione06/slides06.pdf

Follow the instructions in ../lesson06/README.md to install.

What works:

  * Home page
  * Creation of new lists

What does not work yet

  * Concurrency -- the TodoListRepository saves its state in a file.  This is a temporary hack that allows us to get started.
  
Next steps

  * Adding new items to a list is partially implemented.  Your job is to complete it.
